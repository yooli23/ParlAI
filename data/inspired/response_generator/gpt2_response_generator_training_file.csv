It is subtitled, obviously, but as a film buff I do check lists that come out in which critics rank their favorite movies and [MOVIE_TITLE_0] consistently ranks as one of the best, if not the best, [MOVIE_GENRE_0] of all time. B: I'm not much of a film buff, but always happy to check out some films from before my time that I may have overlooked! Another good one that the critics also seem to like is ""[MOVIE_TITLE_2],"" have you seen that? A: Unfortunately no, I had not even heard of it. As you mentioned liking historically accurate, I do enjoy those as well. Although they might not be presented from the viewpoint of an important figure, they usually revolve around a important event like The Biggest Short with [MOVIE_P_ACTOR_0], Steve Carrell and [MOVIE_P_ACTOR_1]. It presents a point of view about what led to the 2008 economic crash. B: I did enjoy the Biggest Short.

If you're looking for a crime/drama like [MOVIE_TITLE_0], I'd recommend Goodfellas, [MOVIE_TITLE_1], or [MOVIE_TITLE_2]. Or do you mean a non-fiction movie, like a [MOVIE_GENRE_0] B: Those are all great movies and seen them all several times. I do like documentary's too! I recently saw one about the foods we eat. I don't remember the name but was very captivating. Do you like documentary's? A: Yes, I do! I like [MOVIE_GENRE_0] that focus around [MOVIE_GENRE_1] Ever since I was a baby, my mom would always be watching true [MOVIE_GENRE_2] [MOVIE_GENRE_0] and shows. That's probably why!

Looking for a recommendation/trailer:) A: Are you looking for something that is newer, or do you not care when it came out? B: I don't have a preference on release date...just looking for something with [MOVIE_GENRE_0] [MOVIE_GENRE_2] would work, too! Any ideas?? A: I really enjoy all of the [MOVIE_TITLE_0] movies. One of my more recent favorite Marvel movies was [MOVIE_TITLE_1]. I enjoyed the historical aspects of it as well as the difference that was a female lead. B: I loved [MOVIE_TITLE_2]..[MOVIE_TITLE_2] is a great recommendation - it might even fill in the missing gaps for me in [MOVIE_TITLE_1]. I will take you up on that recommendation. Thank you!.. Is there a trailer for it? I was also thinking about [MOVIE_TITLE_3] movie that is coming out on Dec 20th. Haven't see a trailer though. A: There is a trailer for [MOVIE_TITLE_1] Did you want me to find a link for it? I'm also looking forward to the new [MOVIE_TITLE_3] movie, and have seen the trailers that they play every once and awhile on TV! B: If you have a link for [MOVIE_TITLE_1] would be great! I'll keep a look out for the [MOVIE_TITLE_3] Trailer, too. DId you know that [MOVIE_TITLE_4] from the MCU is coming out with a movie in 2020? I would love to see that trailer!!! A: [MOVIE_TITLE_1] is a link to the [MOVIE_TITLE_5] trailer! I heard that there was going to be a Black Widow movie coming out but I'm not sure how it's going to work becuase of what happened in Endgame - but I am excited to see it and see what happens! B: Thanks for the link and the recommendation. I will be watching [MOVIE_TITLE_1] tonight. I think the [MOVIE_TITLE_4] movie will be pre-[MOVIE_TITLE_2] and from a timeline standpoint occur between the 2 [MOVIE_TITLE_6]s movies. Thanks again for the idea!",You're Welcome!

A: Well, my absolute favorite movie of all time is [MOVIE_TITLE_0] and it's pretty science fiction(y)-- have you ever seen it? B: Yes, I have seen it. Great movie, [MOVIE_P_ACTOR_0] a good actor. So was [MOVIE_P_ACTOR_1]. A: I completely agree-- the entire movie just blew my mind because it's [MOVIE_GENRE_0] but it's honestly something that actually could happen one day.

Right now I'm wondering why Spiderman wasn't included in the avengers, wasn't he also a [MOVIE_P_DIRECTOR_3] A: He was-- Spiderman actually shows up in the third [MOVIE_TITLE_5] Movie, [MOVIE_TITLE_2] I think he was an addition that they hadn't thought of before, so they introduced him first in [MOVIE_TITLE_6]: Civil before he was actually in Spiderman: Homecoming. But yes, he is introduced in the third [MOVIE_TITLE_1] movie and then he is in all of the subsequent [MOVIE_TITLE_2]'s movies!

A: Nice, so you're a fan well-choreographed combat? Any specific movies or shows besides [MOVIE_TITLE_0] B: Drunken Master and other [MOVIE_P_ACTOR_0] are up my alley. Well-choreographed fighting is intriguing to me for sure. A: Drunken Master is great, he's got such a cool style of fighting. Are you into franchises or film series (if they're good), or are you more of a standalone film fan? B: I'm fine with either, [MOVIE_TITLE_1] has a pretty good franchise although I can't say the recent movies are great, but I can take or leave franchises compared to standalone films. A: I totally get it, the franchises can often bring quality down. Have you by any chance seen [MOVIE_TITLE_2] B: Yes I have, got the chance to see Chapter 2 and 3 in theatres, looking forward to the next iteration. A: Ok solid that's a great series. What about [MOVIE_TITLE_3]? B: I haven't heard about that movie, what's it about? A: It's a pretty gritty [MOVIE_GENRE_0] [MOVIE_GENRE_1] starring [MOVIE_P_ACTOR_1], where he plays a former mercenary who deals with his trauma by taking down a human trafficking network and rescuing the girls they had captive. Would you be interested in watching the trailer? B: Sounds similar to [MOVIE_TITLE_4], but sure, I'll give it a go. A: It's better than [MOVIE_TITLE_5] much more intense and less by-the-numbers. Enjoy! B: Thank you! A: You should also check out the Kingsmen series, first one was great and second one was kind of ok, but the third one looks much better. B: I've heard that, I only saw the first Kingsman and was more enamored by the clothes.",Hahaha fair.

What types of movies do you typically enjoy watching? What was the last film you saw? B: My tastes are pretty varied, but I tend to prefer stuff with a decent amount of [MOVIE_GENRE_0] or a good sense of humor. Not outright [MOVIE_GENRE_1] just [MOVIE_GENRE_2] movies. For example, the last movie I saw in theaters, if I'm remembering correctly, was [MOVIE_TITLE_0] a couple months back. That was pretty funny. A: I absolutely loved [MOVIE_TITLE_0] I was hoping I'd be able to recommend it, truth be told. There was certainly plenty of [MOVIE_GENRE_0] in the latest [MOVIE_TITLE_1] film, if you're into that. I gravitate towards a lot of [MOVIE_GENRE_2] and [MOVIE_GENRE_3] films, myself. B: [MOVIE_TITLE_0] was great, but its advertising campaign painted a pretty bland picture of the movie... All its trailers sold it short by a longshot. And Star Wars films always have [MOVIE_GENRE_0] but I was a bit burnt out on the current trilogy after watching The Last Jedi, and the rumors about the thing with Palpatine turned me away from it immediately. Didn't stop me from loving Solo, though - there's nothing better than an entertaining heist movie. Anyway... I don't like [MOVIE_GENRE_2] I'm a squeamish wuss, and also from my perspective those movies' trailers all kinda just blend together...","I think that's a fair observation of the genre, unfortunately. While the humor may not be as present, Rian Johnson's premier film called Looper was excellent as well, I thought. Films like Brick and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels also come to mind.",[]

B: That sounds awesome, I think I'm gonna watch it. I really like movies like that. Ones with weird twists and good cinematography. Thanks! A: No problem at all, I'm glad I was able to help, it's difficult to find good movies sometimes it seems. B: Yeah, did you like the [MOVIE_TITLE_0] I thought it was really good. I also really liked the Dark Night Batman movies A: Yes, and I forgot to mention that the same director, [MOVIE_P_DIRECTOR_0] directed Memento too speaking of those movies, and yes I thought the Joker was an excellent film, I love it when you can see the character slowly start to change throughout the film, whether it's improving or succumbing to madness like Joaquin Pheonix was able to do in that move with his character. B: OMG no way! that is crazy... I had no idea. You must be good at reccommending movies then. lol I love all Christophen Nolan movies and the Cinematographer he works with is amazing! A: Thank you for the compliment, but I'm no expert I just happened to notice it was him and when you mentioned [MOVIE_TITLE_1] I was like, ""Oh yeah I remember he directed that movie"". B: Haha, wierd. What are some other ones similar to memento that you like? A: That's a tough one because it is a unique film, but going off of the genre you mentioned earlier, psychological [MOVIE_GENRE_1] I think Identity is another good one where the main guy has schizophrenia and his personalities end up killing each other within his own head. It's quite a brain twister. B: oh wow, that makes me think of that movie, [MOVIE_TITLE_2]","Yes that one is also excellent, a classic [MOVIE_P_ACTOR_2] movie.",[]
