     model: hello, how are you doing today?
hello
    labels: what kind of movies do you like? seen anything recently that you liked?
     model: what kind of movies do you like?
i like action movies and military or sci-fi movies the best
    labels: that's great, do you prefer stuff that's realistic or do you prefer stuff that's out there?
     model: what was the last movie you watched?
i prefer realistic but don't mind watching something out there every once in a while
    labels: gotta watch stuff that's out there sometimes, but realistic is good too.
     model: what was the last movie you watched?
true that!
    labels: so i imagine a sci-fi military movie would be great for you.
     model: what was the last movie you watched?
yeah for sure
    labels: any particular director's you're fond of?
     model: have you seen any of the star wars movies?
i don't have a good memory for directors, there's one i remember i like but don't remember even which films of there's i prefer, christopher nolan, jj abrams come to mind
    labels: have you seen ender's game?
     model: i like jj abrams too.
i don't think so, i've heard of it before but didn't get around to seeing it yet
    labels: i thought it was pretty good. maybe not for everyone but should be satisfying if you're into futuristic takes on military ethics.
     model: it's a good movie.
yeah, for sure, i will give it a try, sounds like it might be a good fit for me
    labels: cool, it's got harrison ford in it and it's based on a good book.
     model: i think you'll enjoy it.
yeah, someone recommended me the book before, but i will watch the movie instead, thanks for the recc.
    labels: no problem, i hope you enjoy it.
     model: no problem. enjoy the movie!

    labels: hello friend!
     model: hello, how are you doing today?
good afternoon! i'm looking for a movie recommendation, something to get my mind off of the current status of our country. i love comedies and since laughter is the best medicine, i'd like to find a family friendly comedy to lift my spirits.
    labels: sure, have you seen inside out or coco? the creators have made another movie coming out soon.
     model: what is the last movie you watched?
no, i haven't seen either one. any actors i would recognize in inside out?
    labels: inside out is an animated movie by disney, it's definitely family friendly, not really a comedy
     model: jordan peele and jordan peele's son, jordan peele.
that sounds like an excellent recommendation! thank you! hope you have a nice weekend, goodbye :)
    labels: amy poehler, bill hader, lewis black, richard kind are among the cast
     model: you too!
amy poehler is a hoot!
    labels: i really like the movie, very easy to relate. definitely gives you that warm feeling afterward.
     model: she's hilarious, i love her in the movie "the spy who dumped me"
is coco animated as well?
    labels: yes, it is.
     model: yes, it's a disney movie.
would you say their are morals/lessons learned targeted towards children in one or both of these?
    labels: i would say so. in my opinion, inside out shows children that it is normal to have crazy mixture of emotion during stressful times. the key is to have good communication with people you trust. coco shows the importance of family and tradition.
     model: i would say both.
i personally feel that it is very important that children know that it's okay to 'feel' different ways. i'm leaning towards watching inside out first. what year was that released?
    labels: i agree. it was released in 2015
     model: it was released in 2017.
would you happen to know if either of these films are currently offered on netflix?
    labels: inside out is not on netflix, but you can find it on youtube, googleplay, and amazon prime for $3, same for coco
     model: i do not know if either of these films are currently on netflix.
wonderful! i have an amazon prime account. are these movies both rated g?
    labels: they are both rated pg

    labels: hi there!
     model: hello, how are you doing today?
hello
    labels: have you seen any of the best picture nominees this year 2920?
     model: what kind of movies do you like?
i'm not sure what the nominees are, to be honest.
    labels: well, i see you like classics then, like me, is it correct?
     model: what kind of movies do you like?
that depends on which classics, but yes, some of the movies can be pretty good. what was the name of the one recently...mutiny on the bounty? was pretty good.
    labels: well i can recommend you some classics, like titanic, terminator 1, matrix, and so on, but i have one that is my all time favorite movie, do you like to know its name?
     model: mutiny on the bounty was a great movie, i really enjoyed it.
sure, what's your all-itime fave?
    labels: contact 1997 with jodie foster. under my point of view, it is the most beautiful and meaningful movie ever made, did you watch it ?
     model: i would say the godfather part 1, have you seen it?
no, i haven't. wasn't there also a more recent movie with that name, with the aliens?
    labels: i haven't heard about a new one, but that one is something worth to spend couple of hours watching. it has a great great message, it is very interesting, her performance is tremendous and it leaves you a good taste. i recommend you to watch it, and you will evaluate it by yourself
     model: yes, there was. it was called "interstellar". have you seen that one?
sure. one quick question though, what's the genre?
    labels: drama, even thou it has lots of action and technology
     model: it is a drama, with a great cast of actors, including the main actress, and the supporting cast is also great.
awesome. i'll see if i can get the chance to check it out.
    labels: great! you won't regret it, i can bet
     model: great, i hope you will enjoy it
alright. can i get a second reccomendation, actually? not because the first one is bad by any means, just need an additional one :d
    labels: well, another picture i enjoyed a lot, which is less profound, but with a great message too is "juno", it is very light but with very good story, have you watched it ?
     model: sure, i recommend the movie "the irishman"
i've definitely at least heard of it, i think. was it an animated movie by any chance?
    labels: no, it is about a girl who gets pregnant at 16 and it starts a big drama with a happy ending. jenifer garner is one of the main actresses and the movie won an oscar too
     model: it was, and it won an academy award for best picture

     model: it's about a girl who gets on a train and has to live with the people on the train

    labels: the main character normally sees a couple on a train, then one day sees something happen in the couple's backyard. she then finds out that the girl in the couple is now missing and reports it to the police, but also starts to investigate on her own.
     model: it's called the notebook.
ah a nosy main character. in real life she would be crazy. sounds interesting. i accept your recommendation.

     model: hello, how are you doing today?
i am well and you?
    labels: glad to hear it. i am doing pretty good just surviving this storm we have going on with all this corona virus stuff lol. it actually gives me more reasons to stay inside and watch more movies i have fallen behind on. i just got done watching contagion last night. what kind of movies and stuff do you watch?
     model: i am doing well thank you. what kind of movies do you like?
haha that is funny you mention contagion, i also just watched thay because of all this craziness. i usually like a solid, creative plot - also i do like scifi as well but not superhero movies. i am exhausted of superhero movies.
    labels: i can't say i blame you about the superhero thing they have kind of beaten that one into the ground. i am glad you like sci-fi! i do too! have you ever seen i am legend with will smith? i thought it was really well done and loved will smith and his struggle with being alone and trying to deal with his own depression while trying to survive it all!
     model: i agree. i am not a big fan of superhero movies either. i like sci-fi as well. what was the last movie you watched?
actually no i haven't but i really like will smith and that sounds like a plot i would enjoy. i was also looking for a recommendation to watch for later tonight. i also enjoy watching a character go through the hero's journey, if you will, so it sounds like i'll check that out! i approve of that recommendation and thank you for the advice!
    labels: of course! i think you will love it especially with you liking sci-fi and strong plot lines. maybe check check out the trailer and get a preview of what you are getting into. bring snacks and a friend to hold onto lol. there are some pretty intense moments and some really sad ones too. i am glad you have a plan for the night now. would you like to watch this trailer?
     model: you're welcome! i hope you enjoy it!
yeah i think there aren't many actors who can hold a movie alone but will smith definitely can. i will! i'll make sure to watch the trailer first. thanks again. yes, i would like to watch this trailer.
    labels: of course mate. please enjoy it i have seen it like 5 times or more haha. it'll absolutely hold your attention and mr. smith is awesome. have a great rest of your day and i hope my advise leads you to another classic you love. take care, j
     model: great! i am sure you will enjoy it.
thanks again! have a good one :)
    labels: hey i think i can actually send this trailer to you if you would like?
     model: you too, j!

    labels: of course. i am working on getting that over to you now or i can send you a link to the right one.
     model: no problem. i think you'll really enjoy it.
okay thanks, i appreciate it as i'm not too savvy on the computer. do you have a link by chance?
    labels: you got it! also, what was the last thing you saw will smith in aside from this movie you are going to watch tonight?
     model: i do. i am going to send it over now.
perfect, thanks! i would have to say the latest release of bad boys with martin lawrence. i can't remember if the name is bad boys 3 or a spinoff name like bad boys "reloaded" - also i wanted to see him in gemini man but never did. have you heard how that movie is or seen it?
    labels: i have seen gemini man and i have to say maybe not his best work but was still entertaining for something lazy and entertaining. also, i love the bad boys series lol. they remind me of my childhood.
     model: i have not seen it yet, but i hear it is good. i have heard that it is a little bit of a departure from the other bad boys movies. have you seen any of the other ones?
haha yes! did you watch the fresh prince of bel air at all? i did as kid
    labels: oh yea! that was my jam. i am pretty sure on a yearly basis i go back and watch a few episodes so the theme song is forever stuck in my head... aka: its happening right now...... lol i guess i have been following his work for a very very long time now.
     model: yes i did. i remember the episode where he went to the beach and got a sunburn lol.
haha yeah i mean think he was only around 17, 18 when he started the show, possibly younger. and he's still in hollywood! so we basically watched him grow up as we did
    labels: yes, same here. i pretty much grew up that way.
     model: oh yea! i remember him being in hollywood. i think he was in the movie "the boy next door" with will smith.
well thank you so much for giving me the recommendation and the link to watch that trailer. i will definitely do that! take care :)
    labels: you too! enjoy

    labels: hi! how are you? i'd love to know what type of movies you're into.
     model: hello, how are you doing today?
hi! i'm really into horror movies. have you seen midsommar recently?
    labels: no i haven't, most horror movies scare me too much. did you see the new it?
     model: i have! i really enjoyed it. have you seen any of the new jason movies?
i haven't yet! not the one where they're all adults.
    labels: i've heard really great things about it. quite a few people i know have raved about it. is it something you'd be interested in?
     model: i haven't seen that one yet either. have you seen the new zombieland movie?
yeah, it would be. i think it'll be something i really enjoy.
    labels: i hope you like it. i remember right after it came out my coworker would leave a red balloon in the break room to freak people out.
     model: what was the last horror movie you watched?
i think i will. the first one spooked me out a bit. clowns freak me out, lol.
    labels: oh for sure me too. what about the movie child's play? i remember the originals from being little. did you see the new one?
     model: haha, i can understand that. i think you'll really enjoy it.

    labels: yep! i bet she's good in it, she's a great actress.

yeah, she's awesome. i'll probably check it out just for her.
    labels: nice, hope you like it!
     model: awesome! i hope she enjoys it.
we'll see. i think a doll as a horror villain is a little silly. it's the kind of horror you just laugh at.
    labels: haha that's a really good point. i'd still be scared probably though.
     model: i agree, i think it's a little too much.
lol, i just imagine me like throwing the doll or something. do you know any horror movies that are more based on real life and not supernatural?
    labels: yeah texas chainsaw massacre and that one with paul walker and the truck drivers, i can't remember the name of it.
     model: i do! do you like the shining?
texas chainsaw massacre? what's it about?
    labels: this group of friends goes to see if one of their grandparents graves was vandalized and a bunch of psycho murderers that live next door attack them and they have to escape.
     model: it's a horror movie about a man who is a doctor in texas who is working on a patient who has a chainsaw for a leg. he accidentally cuts off his leg and then the patient starts to try and kill him.

     model: what was the last suspensful movie you watched?
yes that sounds very interesting. did it have a lot of twists and turns?
    labels: it's the type of movie where you won't see the end coming. do you like daniel craig or chris evans?
     model: it has a few twists and turns, but it's not a movie that will leave you thinking about it for a long time. it's a very fast-paced thriller. would you be interested in watching the trailer?
yes. love those kinds of movies. i am not so familiar with the cast you mention. but i think you have made an excellent recommendation. thank you!
    labels: so would like to watch this movie trailer?

yes i would. i accept.
    labels: awesome, hope you end up liking it. take care!
     model: great! i hope you enjoy it.
you must tell me your best part of the movie.
    labels: it's definitely daniel craig's performance.
     model: i think the best part was when the main character was in the hospital and he met the doctor who was working on him.
what other movies has he played in?
    labels: most people know him from 007. i was shocked to see him doing a southern accent in knives out.
     model: he was in the movie "last christmas" with emilia clarke.
ohhh. i know who he is now... southern accent.. hmm interesting. did you watch this at the theater ?
    labels: i actually saw it at home. it would definitely be good to see at home or in theater's.
     model: yes, i did.
is it streaming on netflix?
    labels: not yet. you can it on amazon prime for $3.99 and probably also through your cable provider.
     model: it is!
you think its worth the cost then?
    labels: definitely! it's one of my favorite movies this year.
     model: i think it is. it has a lot of action and a good story.
i think you may have talked me into it then.
    labels: great, have a great night! (i think the chat is actually done now)

    labels: hi! how are you?
     model: hello, how are you doing today?
great although a bit anxious because of the pandemic!
    labels: i totally get that! i'm here to help!
     model: oh, i'm sorry to hear that. what kind of movies do you like?
i'm thinking that now is a time to escape for a while and go back in time to a kinder, gentler place
    labels: what was the last movie that you watched like that?
     model: that sounds like a great idea! what kind of movies do you like?
little women directed by greta gerlich
    labels: oh that's so good! i watched that with my daughter! i like period pieces as well
     model: oh, i've heard of that one! what did you like and dislike about it?
i especially like what the director did with the time sequences jumping out of order. it kept the movie from being to predictable.
    labels: yes! i love it when it keeps me engaged and wanting to know what is next!
     model: yes! i agree. did you like the movie "the boy next door"?
so i'm looking for a film that has that similar quality, and sympathetic characters. and of course, no extreme violence. i also like films that present women overcoming obstacles.
    labels: have you seen lady bird? it's a coming of age indie film also by greta gerwig
     model: have you seen the movie the secret life of walter mitty?
that was with sacirse ronan and timothee chalamet? i have seen it but don't exactly remember the story, so that is a great suggestion for watching tonight!
    labels: would you like to see the trailer to see if it jogs your memory? it's a coming of age story and saoirse ronan is pretty amazing!
     model: yes it was! it's a very beautiful film and has a very interesting story.
that would be great! is it set in present time?
    labels: it is - 2002 i believe!
     model: it's set in the past, but it's set in a fictionalized version of the 1920s. it's set in a small town in virginia.
are you sending me the link to the trailer? if so, i will be glad to watch it and most likely to view the movie. i also like laurie metcalf, who is in the movie.
    labels: i am! laurie was my favorite character in the old sitcom roseanne!
     model: i believe it is on hbo now, but i will send the trailer!
oh, yes, of course - totally forgot that she was in roseanne. not sure if you are actually sending a link to lady bird, but now i am eager to watch it again as there are so many in the cast that i really like. i think i remember a scene with mother and daughter in goodwill. is that right?
    labels: yes! you are right!! i think it's a considered a classic moment now :)
     model: yes! i think that was the last episode of the series.
i really don't need to see the trailer. i fully intend to curl up with a cup of tea and watch "lady bird" tonight. thank you so very much for reminding me of a movie i really liked a lot! have a good evening - i know i will.
    labels: yay! here it is just in case :)  enjoy your evening!!!

that's a good one, i saw that a while back. i thought it was pretty good but i could see why the ratings wouldn't be great. i still haven't seen the second one.
    labels: i've seen about half of it. pretty funny, same characters. need to finish it

hi! i'm looking for a uplifting movie and is pretty corny at times. do you have any suggestions?
    labels: are you looking for a newer movie or do you not care how old it is?
     model: what is the last movie you watched?
i don't mind if it's older. i actually seem to prefer old rom-coms such as the wedding date, must love dogs, and hallmark movies. i'm also a hug fan of pride and prejudice. i love movies that have handsome male characters that have terrible first impressions.
    labels: i feel you on the handsome characters!! for a good rom com i enjoyed the movie valentines day. for something up lifting my favorite movie is last holiday with queen latifah.
     model: i love all those movies too! i think you would really enjoy the movie "the notebook"
can you tell me more about last holiday? i do like christmas movies a lot! i think i saw valentine's day and wasn't a fan but i could be thinking of another movie as well.
    labels: of course! it is a romantic comedy-drama. the film stars queen latifah as georgia, a humble store assistant who is told that she has a rare brain condition and only has a few weeks to live. she promptly decides to spend her last funds on a luxury holiday in europe (like a last hurrah) and she falls in love too!
     model: it's a rom com and it stars will ferrell. it's a very funny movie and it has a very sweet message.
the brain condition sounds really sad. without spoiling the ending will i be crying at the end of the movie or smiling?
    labels: you will be smiling at the end! i promise it is a comedy as well
     model: i think you will be smiling! it is a very sweet and funny movie.
okay! i'll take a change on it. thank you so much for your help!
    labels: you are very welcome :)
     model: no problem! enjoy the movie!
can you tell me more about the person she falls in love with?
    labels: he is one of her co-workers who she flirts with, but doesn't realize he is into her!
     model: she falls in love with a man who is a doctor in new york city.
so is the trip she takes to europe a business trip? also does she have any family or friends that she has for support?
    labels: it is not a business trip it is a trip she takes to go live her life and do all these things on her bucket list after she finds out about all the bad news (but i promise you it is a happy ending) she has 1-2 friends and her family isn't in the story line really.
     model: yes, she goes to europe for a business trip. she has a few friends that she can lean on.
so her co-worker shows up to the resort she in by chance?
    labels: he goes there with a purpose to deliver her certain news and i do not want to spoil the ending haha!
     model: yes, she is going to europe and she is going to meet a guy there.
that's okay! the main character in this movie. how would you describe her in three words?
    labels: brave, smart, and humble
     model: she is a beautiful woman with a beautiful soul.
